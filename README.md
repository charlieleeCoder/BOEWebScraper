## BOEWebScraper

# Code
A webscraper for BoE base rates (personal project).

# Aims/Goals
- Rebuilding another project from scratch that I'm familiar with, in order to practice OOP design patterns.
- Getting some guidance on various commits from experienced C# dev.
- Attempting to avoid Pythonic bad habbits in the process, e.g. global variables, direct access, etc.
- More familiarity with C# syntax more generally.

# Methodology (subject to change)
- Implement builder pattern
- Use dependency injection
- Avoid simply implementing static methods
- Greater Seperation of Concerns
